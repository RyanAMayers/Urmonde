The region of Ghaurd is a large peninsula jutting east off the mainland of the continent [[Çeunae]] (TSU-nye). It is separated from the rest of [[Çeunae]] by a mountain range, and the region itself is mountainous and predominantly temperate, with highlands to the north and west leading into plains in the middle and east, and an archipelago off the southeastern coast.

The region of Ghaurd was especially affected by the Fracture, with many of the powers that held influence in that region dissolving or reforming. The main outcome of The Fracture in Ghaurd was a power vacuum, which would be filled by the six major pantheons of that region. These churches and schools of faith would exert more and more influence on the region and the people, until they eventually became the primary entities of power. People belonged to their pantheon as their nation, and the hierarchy of clerics and holy people became governments for these people, ruling on the principles of their pantheon.
