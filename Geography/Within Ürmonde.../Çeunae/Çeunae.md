Çeunae

The continent of Çeunae (TSU-nye) is a northern, densely populated continent. It is covered mostly by temperate and boreal forests, with a harsh taiga at the far north. It is separated by the neighboring continent of [[Thrisse]] by an imposing, nearly impassible mountain range. For this reason, Çeunae and [[Thrisse]] are relatively isolated culturally, and what little trade occurs between the two areas is accomplished by boat.

  

**The Fracture**

Following years of growing tension due to expanding borders and increased national presence by each of the then-newly-organizing nations, the continent of Çeunae erupted into a complex set of wars, with each political entity, from the small hamlets and villages to the organized nations and pantheons, fighting out their grudges and conflicts with each other. The Fracture was less of a single event and more of a number of smaller wars and conflicts starting as a result of boiling tension.
