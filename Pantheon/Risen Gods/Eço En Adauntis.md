_There is no truer sense than the Basis. The zeroth sense is the only thing that can be guaranteed. The material senses lie to you, deceive you, make you feel like you understand. Learn from the teachings of the Truthseeker, Eço En Adauntis, and learn the truths that the material is hiding._

**Appearance**

They appear as a slender, translucent, androgynous humanoid, not discernibly belonging to any race or sex. Eço is known to be an ascended humanoid, but it is not known who they were before they rose to become the Truthseeker god. They are faded and blurred, impossible to focus on or see clearly. Few have seen them, and they seldom visit the material plane. When one communes with Eço en Adauntis, it is rarely verbal, but instead usually in ideas, images, or memories. Direct depictions of Eço are considered taboo, and instead representative imagery is used when depicting the Blind Skeptic. Often used are images of faceless, formless humanoids, lost in study or meditation, and usually blindfolded. Also common is the raven, a particularly favored creature to Eço.

**Symbology**

**Full Symbol**

Eço’s full symbol is a blindfolded raven. This raven is usually depicted on the ground, rarely in flight. The raven is chosen based on Eço’s story of envying the perspective of a bird as it soars, and feeling perceptually trapped on the ground, unable to share in the deeper understanding of geography which a bird must have.

**Minor Symbol**

Eço’s minor symbol is an icon of a blindfold, a line curved into an ellipse and crossed over at the top. The blindfold is an important symbol in Eço faith, representing the incomplete perception and knowledge offered by one’s senses alone. The symbol can also be interpreted as representing one being trapped on the material plane and limited only to the knowledge that it offers.

**Colors and Aesthetics**

There are few colors or styles associated with Eço en Adauntis. Aesthetics and art are of little importance to Eço philosophy. Little is made or used with decoration in mind, save for some holy symbols and depictions. Furnishings and buildings are made with utility in mind, and simply use whatever materials are most easily obtainable and reasonable.

  

**Role in the World**

**History**

Before ascending to godhood, Eço was a talented student of magic, a practitioner of the school of Illusion. They were also curious and skeptical, tending to experiment and question what they were taught. They frequently questioned lessons, and would ask other scholars and teachers for confirmation or refutation of what they were taught. Eventually, Eço decided to take it upon themself to guide their studies, exploring into other schools and learning about the world.

Eço began tinkering with Divination magic, taking to it with aptitude and enthusiasm. The more they learned and developed their divination, the more they started to resent the principle of Illusion magic and its deceptive, dishonest nature. Eço’s quick turn against Illusion magic began to snowball into a distrust of all illusory practices, and even a paranoia of Illusions and deception. They started to focus their studies and interest toward their own mind, exploring their senses and trying to determine if there was anything they could consider certain and absolute. They began to discount each sense, as well as their own memory, judgment, and even their physical body, as uncertain and without guarantee.

This search led them to the zeroth sense, Basis, the sense of their own awareness and existence. As they explored this, they were able to widen and train this sense, eventually becoming the first creature to use Truesight and perceive the ethereal plane. With more training and practice, Eço was able to fully realize their Basis, and, as with their greater reliance on Basis over the material senses, began to fade from the material and ascend to a purely ethereal being, where they continue today to study and learn about the nature of their existence, occasionally blessing with knowledge those who they believe could help them on their journey to understanding.

**Philosophy and Faith Practices**

**The Truest Sense**

Eço en Adauntis is most associated with a skepticism toward their own senses and perception. Many facets of how someone lives and makes judgements about the world are unacceptably unreliable, and upsettingly vulnerable to manipulations. One can’t wholly trust their own senses, their own memory, their own judgement, with complete certainty. Senses can be dulled or imperfect, memories fade and shift over time naturally, and judgement is clouded by one’s experiences, biases, and preferences. In a world where people forget things, the old go blind and deaf, and there exists an entire school of magic devoted to manipulating one’s perception, none of the five conventional senses can be trusted.

However, Eço clerics and followers believe in another sense. A zeroth sense, below and before all others. This sense is often called Basis, Truesight, or Awareness, and the most central tenant of Eço faith is to recognize this sense and expand your perception through it. Basis is the inward sense, dealing with mindstate, emotion, and basic self-awareness. Basis is seen by Eço philosophy as a sort of spiritual proprioception. It senses not anything in the material plane, but your inner self, the part of you that belongs not to the material, but to the spiritual. Training your sense of Basis is said to teach you about your nature not as a creature, but as a life, as a consciousness.

**The Raven and the Beetle**

Before their enlightenment, Eço once took a walk in the forest to satiate their curiosity and observe the animals that lived within it. While resting under a tree, Eço noticed a beetle scuttling beside them over leaves and brush. They put their hand down in front of the beetle, and, sure enough, the beetle climbed into it, and Eço was able to pick it up and clasp their hands around it, trapping it. Eço wondered to themself, is the beetle aware that it’s trapped? Does it understand what kind of a creature I am, that I can pick it up and restrain it without effort or opposition? Does it understand what kind of a creature it is, or have any sense of its own nature and its relative ignorance? While wondering this to themself, though, Eço was startled to see a raven land gently on their arm, looking inquisitively back and forth between Eço and their hands. When Eço lifted their hand to reach over and touch the raven, it quickly grabbed the beetle, swallowed it, and soared straight up into the sky, and Eço lost track of it, as the sun was bright and the trees were obstructive. Eço turned their thoughts of perception and understanding toward themself, as they had been outsmarted and made foolish by the raven, and they felt envious of this creature of the sky, who must have exceptional eyesight to have seen Eço catch the beetle, and impressive intelligence to plan its heist. This was the first time Eço saw themself as limited in perception and status.

The raven, who possesses exceptional hearing and eyesight, is a very common symbol for Eço en Adauntis and their pantheon. This story is used to illustrate how simple it can sometimes be to break down the false security one has in one’s senses, and how a journey toward Truesight can start.

**All Things Can and Must Be Doubted**

Though an Eço follower may genuinely doubt their five traditional senses, they still, of course, use them on a daily basis to get by and live their basic life, but it’s done with an understanding that none of those senses, and therefore the reality which is assumed based on them, is guaranteed. Some others see Eço philosophy as hypocritical, as they shun the use of the five traditional senses but still rely on them to walk, eat, breathe, and exist. In reality, the Eço practice is one of striving toward understanding, not one of abandoning the material world.
