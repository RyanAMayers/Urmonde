## Appearance

He appears as a jolly, fat, human man, with rich, long brown hair, a booming laugh and a warm smile, adorned in numerous cloths and blankets. In depictions, he is often eating, and is strongly associated with feasts and festive meals. He is very rarely depicted alone, often shown among other people who are similarly smiling and laughing, though he seldom is depicted with other gods.

## Symbology

Boarus is strongly associated with harvest, feasting, and plenty. Therefore, much of his symbology is tied to food and agriculture. It is important to note, though, that Boar imagery is not ostentatious. Humility and restraint are not lost on Boarus.

##### Full Symbol

Boarus’s full symbol is a tree, wet from rain, and laden heavy with fruit. He is also represented by a single tree branch, often also with a heavy fruit. These symbols are chosen because Boarus is believed to provide food and plenty to those who wish to enjoy it, but also choose to share it. The Boar Tree bears enough fruit that it can be enjoyed by any who desire it.

##### Minor Symbol

Boarus’s minor symbol is a branching tree icon, split into two and then four. This symbol represents both an abstraction of the Boar Tree and the chain-reaction effect of service, where helping one person can encourage them to help others.

##### Colors and Aesthetics

Boarus is associated with autumnal colors, predominantly red and orange. Rustic, farmhouse aesthetics are common in Boar buildings and homes, mainly due to Boarus’s association with agriculture. Boar style and architecture is rarely ostentatious, opting instead for pleasant but humble choices.

  

## Role in the World

Boarus is credited by many farmers for good harvests, and has a strong association with agriculture and nature. Boarus’s main role in the world is to bring the rain from the heavens down to the ground, sharing the bounty of the skies with the people below. Boarus is also deeply fond of fruit, and so he helps to ensure that it grows true and sweet. More broadly, Boarus helps to ensure good harvests, making sure that enough grows for everyone to enjoy. These are all seen as Boarus providing enough for everyone to have plenty, but only if it is shared and distributed.

##### History

Boarus lived a humble life 

## Philosophy and Faith Practices

##### Here For a Good Time

Boarus champions the pursuit of personal joy and pleasure. Life is no fun when you’re not having fun. Boarus himself is known as a jolly man, and loves humor and story. Clerics of Boarus are taught to seek the joy nested in every experience and every sense. They practice sitting in their temple grounds and closing their eyes to listen to all the sounds they can identify, and then pick a favorite. They have no issue stopping to smell the flowers, and are truly able to relish the sweet scent.

Boarus is often pejoratively associated with hedonism by non-Boars, but his philosophy is slightly different, in that he believes personal joy should be made possible for everyone. Service and charity are important in the Boar faith. Boar people believe that pleasure is hollow when not shared. Boarus loathes greed and hoarding, and it is seen as abhorrent and childish in Boar faith. It is common for Boar temples to be a place of refuge for all who come in need, but also a social center and meeting place. Clerics of Boarus very seldom proselytize their faith unless prompted, though they do actively participate in the community and facilitate charity and service.

##### Passing the Plate

There is a common parable taught to children in which a young Boarus, at a harvest feast, was eager to enjoy a favorite dish of his, a smoked fruit pie, made from produce that his whole family had tended to and grown all year. When the pie was served to the table, Boarus took it and, through stubborn whining and yelling, kept it all for himself. With his family frustrated by his childishness and Boarus paranoid that they would take his delicious treat, he ran off into the cellar and locked himself in to enjoy his pie unopposed. He ate the entire pie, hastily and anxiously, and soon fell sick and nauseated. He stayed in that cellar the entire night, clutching his gut and bemoaning his greed.

This story is taught as an illustration of Boar philosophy because it teaches that pleasure through hoarding and greed is tainted, and that by taking joy from others, you take from yourself, as well. Had Boarus simply taken a fair portion of the pie that was served, he would have never fallen ill, but his childish greed ruined the experience for himself and for all others at the feast, and the joy he expected from the dessert was ruined by not only his sickness from overeating, but also from his fear of losing it.

Based on this story, it is a symbolic act to pass the serving plate around during a meal, representing the joy of giving to others and sharing in the rewards of plentiful harvest, while safe in the security that you will be shared with as well. Pleasure is diminished when you hoard more of the same thing, but you can get more from sharing and serving that which you enjoy.

##### Pleasure Through Fulfillment, Fulfillment Through Pleasure

Boar philosophy invites its followers to engage in that which brings them joy, but not mindlessly. Simple, base pleasure is only part of the story. There is reward in the pursuit of joy, in the betterment of your life and your experience. Variety and curiosity is encouraged. A Boar follower who enjoys wine might choose to try different varieties of wine, learn about how the types of grapes affect it and try to find a favorite, or even visit a vineyard to understand where it comes from. They would ponder what it is about wine they like, how it makes them feel, what they associate with it, or why they prefer it to mead or beer. Experiences are more pleasurable when one is mindful and curious about their enjoyment.

Similarly, the pursuit of pleasure for oneself is hollow if it is only for themself, especially at the expense of another. There is a deepening of the experience of pleasure when it is shared with others, and a hollowing of the experience when it is kept for yourself, because pleasure doesn’t solely come from the senses, but also from the associations and experiences tied to it. Base pleasure is one thing; shared pleasure is entirely another. This is why service is a central tenant of Boar practice: it is the purest expression of bringing joy and benefit to others.
